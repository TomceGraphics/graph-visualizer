A lightweight, browser-based graph visualizer designed to help students and developers visualize graphs and practice graph algorithms. Perfect for algorithm studies and note-taking in tools like Obsidian.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Simple Input Format**: Input graphs using the format `A-B 2` (Node1-Node2 Weight)
- **Export Options**: Save graph as PNG for your notes or presentations
- **No Dependencies**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - runs directly in your browser
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## üöÄ Motivation

When I was studying algorithms and data structures as a course in university, I often found myself needing to visualize graphs from my studies. When practicing with AI tools like ChatGPT, I'd receive graph definitions in formats like `A-B 2` (representing an edge between node A and B with weight 2), but had to draw them manually to visualize them properly.

This tool was born out of that need - a simple, no-frills way to quickly visualize graphs without leaving the browser.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage
**recommended method**
go to https://tomcegraphics.github.io/graph-visualizer/
and thats it

**offline method**
1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser
3. Enter your graph in the input box using the format: `A-B 2` (one edge per line)
4. Click "Visualize" to generate the graph
5. Drag nodes to rearrange the layout as needed
6. Use the "Save as PNG" button to export the graph for your notes

### Example Input
```
A-B 5
A-C 3
B-D 2
C-D 1
D-E 4
```
